# Generative AI Integration with Flutter

This project demonstrates the integration of generative AI capabilities within a Flutter app, utilizing **Gemini models** and a **Reasoning Engine agent** on Google’s Vertex AI platform. The goal is to showcase how generative AI can enhance application interactivity by enabling advanced search and reasoning capabilities, all from a single codebase deployable across multiple platforms.

## Project Objectives

- **Understand Generative AI Concepts**  
  Gain insights into generative AI and explore the models and tools that empower AI-driven applications.

- **Implement Generative AI Features in a Flutter App**  
  Integrate generative AI functionalities into the Flutter app using Gemini and a Reasoning Engine agent, enhancing user engagement through intelligent interactions.

## Technologies Used
- **Flutter** for cross-platform UI development
- **Vertex AI** for generative AI tools and model deployment
- **Gemini Models** for implementing search and reasoning capabilities
- **Reasoning Engine Agent** for enriched, AI-driven app features

This project provides a foundation for developers interested in building AI-powered applications with Flutter and Google’s Vertex AI platform.
